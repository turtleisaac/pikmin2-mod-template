A decompilation of Pikmin 2, modified by turtleisaac to serve as a stepping off point for further mod creation

This repository by default builds the following DOLs:

```
90d328bf8f190c90472e8c19e7e53c6ad0fe0d1a  build/pikmin2.usa/main.dol
3730939092688902af4866be66d4a8404ae752c7  build/pikmin2.usa.demo/main.dol
```

> **Note**  
> The ROM this repository builds can be shifted. You are able to add
> and remove code as you see fit, for modding or research purposes.
>
> To do this, you can add .cpp files to src/moddingU, and then modify
> the contents of src/moddingU/Makefile accordingly to ensure they are
> accounted for.
>
> There's obviously more to it than this, but if you're smart enough
> you'll figure it out. Head over to the projectPiki Discord server
> if you need help.

> **Other Note**  
> After cloning this repo and making your fork, you should do the
> following in order to be able to merge in changes from the parent
> pikmin 2 decomp repo as it progresses and in case any changes
> from it are not yet present in my repo:
`git remote add template https://github.com/projectPiki/pikmin2.git`.
> After this, just do `git fetch --all` and then you'll be able to
> merge changes from the base repo into yours with
`git merge template/main`
> (granted you may encounter merge conflicts)

## Building

### Required Tools
* [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
* python

### Instructions

* WINDOWS ONLY STEP:
	- Launch msys2 (provided by devkitPro) and run the following command:

  ```
  pacman -S msys2-keyring
  ```

1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/projectPiki/pikmin2/`

2. Download [GC_WII_COMPILERS.zip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/727918646525165659/917185027656286218/GC_WII_COMPILERS.zip) and extract the contents of the GC folder to `tools/mwcc_compiler/` - you'll have to make this folder yourself. For example, your directory structure should look like `pikmin2/tools/mwcc_compiler/2.6/` (along with the other versions).

3. Run `make -j` in a command prompt or terminal.
	- -j Allows `make` to use multiple threads, speeding up the process.
	- If just `-j` gives errors on your setup, try specifying a set number of threads, e.g. `make -j 4`.

* OPTIONAL STEPS:
	- Obtain a clean DOL of Pikmin 2 USA 1.0 and place it in the base working directory and rename it to `baserom.dol`.
	- To generate a linker map (takes a considerable amount of time), run `make MAPGENFLAG=1 -j`.
	- The project uses clang-format for a consistent style. Download the [correct version](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/933849922418126918/1031358615300345856/clang-format.exe) and place in the main repo directory (e.g. `pikmin2/clang-format.exe`).

* See [this video](https://youtu.be/CZXNQagqpkw) for a walkthrough of the steps on Windows (thanks Altafen for making this!).

### Decompilation workflow

- The project is compatible with [objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff), which is highly recommended for local decompilation testing. Objdiff can be built from source, or the latest stable build obtained from GitHub actions (recommended).

- To obtain the latest stable build:
	1. Navigate to the `Actions` tab of the objdiff repo.
	2. Select the latest `main` workflow.
	3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and download the `stable` release for your platform (Mac, Linux, Windows).
	4. Extract contents of `.zip` to obtain an executable version.

- To set up objdiff for this project:
	1. Run `objdiff.exe`.
	2. Set:
		- Build config: `None`.
		- Select project dir: `/path/to/cloned/pikmin2`
		- Select target build dir: `/path/to/cloned/pikmin2/build/pikmin2.usa/asm`
		- Select base build dir: `/path/to/cloned/pikmin2/build/pikmin2.usa/src`
			- NB: you may have to specify a custom make path if the desired `make` version is not the default. On Windows, this is likely:
			  `/path/to/devkitPro/msys2/usr/bin/make.exe`
	3. Select desired object file to diff (likely from `pikmin2/build/pikmin2.usa/asm/LIBRARY/OBJECTFILE.o`).
	4. Decomp it!

### Generating Context for decomp.me Scratches
(NB: The generator requires **Python 3** to run)

- [decomp.me](https://decomp.me/) is an online decompilation sharing hub, allowing 'scratches' of functions to be generated and collaborated on.
- Stand-alone decompilation packages and tools such as decomp.me require information on the functions and structures of the project in order to parse extracted blocks correctly. The easiest way to do this is to pass the tool just the necessary 'context' for the file, i.e. a set of all the headers used by the file that's being worked on.
- A recursive context processing script is included in the repo (<a href="https://github.com/projectPiki/pikmin2/tree/main/tools/decompctx.py">tools/decompctx.py</a>), which generates a `ctx.c` file in the root directory.
	- The contents of this can then be copied and pasted into the 'Context' section of a decomp.me scratch or similar.
- To use, call the generator via the terminal/command line from the root directory (replacing DIRECTORY and FILE as required):
  ```python3 tools/decompctx.py src/DIRECTORY/FILE.cpp```
- Credit to encounter and the [Metroid Prime decomp project](https://github.com/PrimeDecomp/prime) for the script!
